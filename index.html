    <div class="title">__finished Business</div>
    <p>
      With my luggage still unloaded,<br>
      you took whatever was left back at yours,<br>
      laid it all over the place,<br>
      tossed it and shut the door close.<br>
      I cannot quite figure out, <br>
      when your rhythm shifted,<br>
      we used to laugh and love so loud,<br>
      that your silence I mistook for a hold 𝄐,<br>
      as you decided the melody was finished.

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="title">Few days ago</div>
    <p>
      Feels like forever since I last spoke to you.<br>
      Happy news feel bittersweet when I can’t share them with you.<br>
      Was the high worth it? For how low everything felt after.<br>
      -I'll add it to the list of unanswered things in my head<br>
      I can't be all that bitter because it was never a bad relationship,<br>
      I never felt unnoticed or taken for granted<br>
      always made me feel so special, so loved.<br>
      and that's what makes it so much harder. <br>
      I wish it wasn't such a hot-cold shock.<br>
      wish I had time to dislike it, dislike you and everything about us.
      But it was very sudden.<br>
      and that dislike hasn't had time to grow, to dampen the punch.<br>
    </p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="title">January 24</div>
    <p>
      I know I shouldn't, but I do want you to reach out.<br>
      Don't want to follow the script and pretend I'm not supposed to feel, but I do.<br>
      We all know we do.<br>
      Hoped that the other one would reach out.<br>
      And I want him to miss me.<br>
      And I know I shouldn't want that.<br>
      My role is to move on, focus only on myself.<br>
      Pouring so much into myself, and thank the world it ended when it had to.<br>
      And I feel silly for wanting a text, a hint of you missing me in your life.<br>
      But not necessarily because I want you back.<br>
      More because I want to be chosen.<br>
      To know that it was real, that it was reciprocated and that it wasn't just all fabricated.<br>
      To know that the time and energy and effort that I gave actually meant something.<br>
      And I think it's not even about you anymore.<br>
      I think it's more about knowing that I wasn't just someone that can be replaced.<br>
      But wanting to be wanted doesn't make me weak, it makes me human.<br>
      I'll keep working towards the day I'll want to be wanted by myself more than someone who chose to walk away.

      <div class="title">Lyrics to "Linger - the Cranberries, Jan 22"</div>
      <p>
        If you, if you could return,<br>
        Don't let it burn, don't let it fade.<br>
        I'm sure I'm not being rude,<br>
        But it's just your attitude,<br>
        It's tearing me apart,<br>
        It's ruining everything.<br>
        I swore, I swore I would be true,<br>
        And honey, so did you.<br>
        So why were you holding her hand?<br>
        <strong>Is that the way we stand?</strong><br>
        <strong>Were you lying all the time?</strong><br>
        <strong>Was it just a game to you?</strong><br>
        But I'm in so deep,<br>
        You know I'm such a fool for you.<br>
        You got me wrapped around your finger.<br>
        Do you have to let it linger?<br>
        <strong>Oh, I thought the world of you.</strong><br>
        <strong>I thought nothing could go wrong.</strong><br>
        But I was wrong, I was wrong.<br>
        If you, if you could get by,<br>
        Trying not to lie,<br>
        Things wouldn't be so confused,</strong><br>
        And I wouldn't feel so used.</strong><br>
        But you always really knew,<br>
        I just wanna be with you.<br>
        - but not anymore.
      </p>
