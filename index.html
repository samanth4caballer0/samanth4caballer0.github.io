    <div class="title">__finished Business</div>
    <p>
      With my luggage still unloaded,<br>
      you took whatever was left back at yours,<br>
      laid it all over the place,<br>
      tossed it and shut the door close.<br>
      I cannot quite figure out, <br>
      when your rhythm shifted,<br>
      we used to laugh and love so loud,<br>
      that your silence I mistook for a hold 𝄐,<br>
      as you decided the melody was finished.

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="title">Few days ago</div>
    <p>
      Feels like forever since I last spoke to you.<br>
      Happy news feel bittersweet when I can’t share them with you.<br>
      Was the high worth it? For how low everything feels now.<br>
      -I'll add it to the list of unanswered things in my head<br>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="title">Lyrics to "Linger - the Cranberries, Jan 22"</div>
    <p>
      If you, if you could return,<br>
      Don't let it burn, don't let it fade.<br>
      I'm sure I'm not being rude,<br>
      But it's just your attitude,<br>
      It's tearing me apart,<br>
      It's ruining everything.<br>
      I swore, I swore I would be true,<br>
      And honey, so did you.<br>
      So why were you holding her hand?<br>
      <strong>Is that the way we stand?</strong><br>
      <strong>Were you lying all the time?</strong><br>
      <strong>Was it just a game to you?</strong><br>
      But I'm in so deep,<br>
      You know I'm such a fool for you.<br>
      You got me wrapped around your finger.<br>
      Do you have to let it linger?<br>
      <strong>Oh, I thought the world of you.</strong><br>
      <strong>I thought nothing could go wrong.</strong><br>
      But I was wrong, I was wrong.<br>
      If you, if you could get by,<br>
      Trying not to lie,<br>
      Things wouldn't be so confused,</strong><br>
      And I wouldn't feel so used.</strong><br>
      But you always really knew,<br>
      I just wanna be with you.<br>
      - but not anymore.
    </p>
