    <div class="title"><strong>__finished Business, Jan 17</strong></div>
    <p>
      With my luggage not yet unloaded,<br>
      you took whatever was left back at yours,<br>
      laid it all over the place,<br>
      tossed it and shut the door close.<br>
      I cannot quite figure out, <br>
      when your rhythm shifted,<br>
      we used to laugh and love so loud,<br>
      that your silence I mistook for a hold 𝄐<br>
      as you decided the melody was finished.

    <div class="title">Few days ago</div>
    <p>
      Feels like forever since I last spoke to you.<br>
      Happy news feel bittersweet when I can’t share them with you.<br>
      Was the high worth it? <br>
      -I'll add it to the list of unanswered things in my head<br> -->
  <!-- I can't be all that bitter because it was never a bad relationship,<br>
      I never felt unnoticed or taken for granted<br>
      always made me feel so special, so loved.<br>
      and that's what makes it so much harder. <br>
      I wish it wasn't such a hot-cold shock.<br>
      wish I had time to dislike it, dislike you and everything about us.<br>
      But it was very sudden.<br>
      and that dislike hasn't had time to grow, to dampen the punch.<br> -->

    <div class="title">January 24</div>
    <p>
      I know I shouldn't, but I do want you to reach out.<br>
      Don't want to follow the script and pretend I'm not supposed to feel, but I do.<br>
      We all know we do.<br>
      Hoped that the other one would reach out.<br>
      And I want him to miss me.<br>
      And I know I shouldn't want that.<br>
      My role is to move on, focus only on myself.<br>
      Pouring so much into myself, and thank the world it ended when it had to.<br>
      And I feel silly for wanting a text, a hint of you missing me in your life.<br>
      But not necessarily because I want you back.<br>
      More because I want to be chosen.<br>
      To know that it was real, that it was reciprocated and not just all fabricated.<br>
      To know that the time, energy, and effort that I gave actually meant something.<br>
      <strong>And I think it's not even about you anymore.</strong><br>
      I think it's more about knowing that I wasn't just someone that can be replaced.<br>
      But wanting to be wanted doesn't make me weak, it makes me human.<br>
      <strong>I'll keep working towards the day I'll want to be wanted by myself more than someone who chose to walk
        away.</strong>

    <div class="title"><strong>Carta al corazón. Jan 26"</strong></div>
    <p>
      La Tierra no lo miró cuando llegó entero, <br>
      sino cuando aceptó quebrarse.<br>
      Ella no lo amó por ser fuerte,<br>
      lo amó por ser vulnerable.<br>

      Curiosa, lo vio entrar sin nombre,<br>
      con manos limpias de intención.<br>
      Y lo cubrió de peso y silencio,<br>
      hasta enseñarle dirección.<br>

      Cada día lo empuja hacia abajo,<br>
      antes de dejarlo subir.<br>
      Porque crecer lo sabe bien la raíz,<br>
      no es avanzar, es resistir.<br>
      Y aunque duela, él lo entiende,<br>
      debajo aprende a sostener.<br>
      Nadie florece por puro deseo,<br>
      florece quien insiste en pertenecer.<br>

      No lo premia por ser suficiente,<br>
      lo aclama por atreverse a arder.<br>
      El suelo ama al que se deja trabajar,<br>
      no al que pide ser.<br>

      Y cuando al fin levanta el rostro,<br>
      no es por luz ni vanidad.<br>
      Es porque algo en aquella sombra<br>
      ha aprendido a llamar hogar.

    <div class="title"><strong>Small ceremonies, Jan 29</strong></div>
    <p>
      I make a cup of coffee,<br>
      brush my teeth, tidy my bed.<br>
      I go in my head over the duties<br>
      to take on my way.<br>
      <br>
      Small ceremonies<br>
      that turn the day unique to me.<br>
      Nothing heroic yet.<br>
      Just the willingness to begin.<br>
      <br>
      Build, maintain, polish, work, invent<br>
      I tend to what is mine to tend:<br>
      my body, my mind, I learn, explore, create<br>
      I care with full intent.<br>
      <br>
      Read a few pages, lift a weight right,<br>
      leave a streak of color, capture the light,<br>
      From the outside it might seem like labour,<br>
      but I know better, these are open doors and I do myself a favour.<br>
      <br>
      Each moment teaches me something quiet.<br>
      Not all at once, or with spectacle,<br>
      but in tiny little fragments.<br>
      A steadier breath, a calmer demeanor,<br>
      a kinder heart to others and myself,<br>
      a hand less afraid to try, oh so eager.<br>
      <br>
      I embrace myself again,<br>
      not through grand reinvention<br>
      its a compromise that i've made to myself <br>
      the promise of daily effort <br>
      ... <br>

    <div class="title"><strong>Lyrics to "Linger - the Cranberries, Jan 22"</strong></div>
    <p>
      If you, if you could return,<br>
      Don't let it burn, don't let it fade.<br>
      I'm sure I'm not being rude,<br>
      But it's just your attitude,<br>
      It's tearing me apart,<br>
      It's ruining everything.<br>
      I swore, I swore I would be true,<br>
      And honey, so did you.<br>
      So why were you holding her hand?<br>
      <strong>Is that the way we stand?</strong><br>
      <strong>Were you lying all the time?</strong><br>
      <strong>Was it just a game to you?</strong><br>
      But I'm in so deep,<br>
      You know I'm such a fool for you.<br>
      You got me wrapped around your finger.<br>
      Do you have to let it linger?<br>
      <strong>Oh, I thought the world of you.</strong><br>
      <strong>I thought nothing could go wrong.</strong><br>
      But I was wrong, I was wrong.<br>
      If you, if you could get by,<br>
      Trying not to lie,<br>
      Things wouldn't be so confused,</strong><br>
      And I wouldn't feel so used.</strong><br>
      But you always really knew,<br>
      I just wanna be with you.<br>
      - but not anymore.
    </p> -->
